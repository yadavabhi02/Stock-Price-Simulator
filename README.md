# Stock Price Simulator

## Overview
The Stock Price Simulator is a sophisticated tool designed to predict future stock prices. Leveraging the Random Walk Theory and the Monte Carlo Method, the simulator estimates the possible movement of a stock for the current month, based on the previous month's data available on yFinance. 

## Key Features

- **Data Scraping**: The simulator uses yFinance to scrape necessary data for a particular stock from the previous month. This data is essential for running simulations and predicting future stock movements.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Based on the Adjusted Closing Price from the scraped data, the simulator applies the Random Walk Theory and the Monte Carlo Method to calculate possible stock movement in the following month. This allows users to make informed decisions about their stock investments.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: With the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn, the simulator provides visually appealing and interactive graphical representations of the predicted stock movements. These visualizations aid users in understanding the output of the simulations.

## Tech Stack
The Stock Price Simulator is built on a robust tech stack designed to provide a reliable and accurate tool for stock price prediction:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for building the simulator. Python's extensive libraries and modules make it a versatile choice for such a complex project.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time-series data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: These two libraries are used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. They help in providing clear and comprehensive graphical representations of the stock movement predictions.
- **yFinance**: This Python library allows for easy download of stock market data from Yahoo Finance, which is then used as the basis for the simulator's predictions.

## Final Thoughts
The Stock Price Simulator serves as a powerful tool for anyone interested in predicting stock price movements. With its robust tech stack and sophisticated algorithms, the simulator can provide invaluable insights to traders and investors. As always, while the simulator is a sophisticated tool, users are reminded that all investment strategies should be used as guidelines and do not guarantee any results.
